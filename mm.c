 * NOTES:
 *  - Explicit allocator with an explicit free-list
 *  - Free-list uses a single, doubly-linked list with LIFO insertion policy,
 *    first-fit search strategy, and immediate coalescing.
 *  - We use "next" and "previous" to refer to blocks as ordered in the free-list.
 *  - We use "following" and "preceding" to refer to adjacent blocks in memory.
 *  - Pointers in the free-list will point to the beginning of a heap block
 *    (i.e., to the header).
 *  - Pointers returned by mm_malloc point to the beginning of the payload
 *    (i.e., to the word after the header).
 *
 * ALLOCATOR BLOCKS:
 *  - USED: +---------------+   FREE: +---------------+
 *          |    header     |         |    header     |
 *          |(size_and_tags)|         |(size_and_tags)|
 *          +---------------+         +---------------+
 *          |  payload and  |         |   next ptr    |
 *          |    padding    |         +---------------+
 *          |       .       |         |   prev ptr    |
 *          |       .       |         +---------------+
 *          |       .       |         |  free space   |
 *          |               |         |  and padding  |
 *          |               |         |      ...      |
 *          |               |         +---------------+
 *          |               |         |    footer     |
 *          |               |         |(size_and_tags)|
 *          +---------------+         +---------------+
 *
 * BOUNDARY TAGS:
 *  - Headers and footers for a heap block store identical information.
 *  - The block size is stored as a word, but because of alignment, we can use
 *    some number of the least significant bits as tags/flags.
 *  - TAG_USED is bit 0 (the 1's digit) and indicates if this heap block is
 *    used/allocated.
 *  - TAG_PRECEDING_USED is bit 1 (the 2's digit) and indicates if the
 *    preceding heap block is used/allocated. Used for coalescing and avoids
 *    the need for a footer in used/allocated blocks.
